# tessocr
A wrapper for Tesseract OCR , providing formatting for resulting data as well , saving in a doc for txt
I have also uploaded the required dependencies. 
The Tesseract DLLs need to be in one of the resource folders , linked in classpath. The Tessdata folder and english.txt in the linked lib folder.
