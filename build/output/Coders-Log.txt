	Spell Check Reduces errors from 26 to 18 in LndT Page


IBMTest Results:

	Run 1 - Coordinate out of bounds error - Probable Error in GetImageText
		Fix- Reworked the Start & End Points of Height and widths.
		The decrease and increase by 25 pixels is now inside the max and Min function, so that it doesn't get out of bounds.

	Run 2 - Program Runs Successfully but after finishing gives an empty page message. Either given by Tesseract or GetImageText. 
		Probably running another thread which would imply Tesseract. Can be that it is trying to read images that  are wrongly detected
		Checked - Error due to Tesseract
		Bug Found: Erroneous Results , if images are present.
		Not that it would just give that there will be no output. It would disrupt the avergae size and the densities.


After Implementing the Classify Feature:
	Using LnT Offer:
		Run 1: Exception in main: java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.Integer; - Problem in Statistical
		
		Has to be:
			return(median(reslist.toArray(new Integer[reslist.size()])));
		Instead of:
			return(median((Integer)reslist.toArray()));

		Run 2: Works, but apparently everything is same.
		
	Using IBM:
		Run 1: No formatting changes, whatsoever 
		BUG: Few Changes havent been made in the docwriter.
		
		Run 2:
			Below Average Results. Isnt looking good.
